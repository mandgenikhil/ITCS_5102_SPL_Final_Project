[Github]

Please find the below major steps and required packages to develop this application.

### Step 1 : Install Golang and required packages
[Golang]

Go is a statically typed, compiled high-level programming language designed at Google by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. It is syntactically similar to C, but with memory safety, garbage collection, structural typing, and CSP-style concurrency
Golang Packages :

- Gin

### Step 2 : Install Node js and ReactJs with required packages

[Nodejs]

Node.js is a cross-platform, open-source server environment that can run on Windows, Linux, Unix, macOS, and more. Node.js is a back-end JavaScript runtime environment, runs on the V8 JavaScript Engine, and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.
NPM packages list:

Install required packages using

```sh
npm install {Package-Name}
```

- react-router-dom
- am4themes
- am4charts
- antd
- bulma

er Acceptance Testing
    Will have one session where all the stakeholders will do UAT.



### Step 5 : Containerize whole application 

After completing the above steps, we will use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) images to containerize our whole web based application into a single deployment.
We need to create a Dockerfile which will hold all the required environment related configurations, such as packages install commands, port enablements, security layers etc.
